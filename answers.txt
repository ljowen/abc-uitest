Q2: The best way to support multiple test targets would be to create multiple config files,
    i.e. wdio.conf.dev.js, wdio.conf.staging.js as shown at http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/organizesuite.html
    extending from a base config wdio.conf.js

    In the case of switching urls, the baseUrl parameter should be modified per environment, and then care should be
    taken that each test uses relative urls (i.e. browser.url('/news')).

    A shell script could then read from an environment variable set and pick the config file:
        "./node_modules/.bin/wdio wdio.conf.[ENVIRONMENT].js",

Q3: While poking around I noticed the ABC API programs endpoint  http://program.abcradio.net.au/api/v1/programs
    returns a list of (presumably) current programs. This endpoint could be queried each test run to generate a list of
    program pages to test against (using the Program page model). This however might cause frustration if the list changes
    regularly so instead a static list of programs to test against could be maintained, either as part of this repository
    or as an external service. Where possible I've attempted to make my tests as generic as possible, but they could be improved
    by removing hardcoded URLs and replacing them with the response from this endpoint.
